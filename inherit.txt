One use for inheritance is for creating subclasses or child classes based on a main or base 
template class so we don't have to keep writing the same initialized values or features for
every subclass if they're using the same values/features. The other use is to build upon 
the base class by using inheritance to have the child class inherit aspects of the base class
while having their own functions or versions of the base class functions/variables.
