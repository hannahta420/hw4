Neither functions change the variables after the function call because they don't
actually change the value of the passed variables. The functions do make changes
to whatever the passed variable is but unless the passed variables are set to
be replaced with the changed values, either through returning 'someval' in both
functions and setting a and b equal to whatever new value the functions return,
it will not change the variables.
